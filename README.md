# Fire-Department-Extra-Script
One of the worst and most annoying things to do is have to equip all your extras and a Fire Department apparatus when you arrive on the scene. It does not necessarily take too much time, it just wastes time when you could be out on a scene. This is where the idea arose. The script uses a / command which allows all apparatus extras to be set with ease.
