# Fire-Department-Extra-Script
One of the worst and most annoying things to do is have to equip all your extras and a Fire Department apparatus when you arrive on the scene. It does not necessarily take too much time, it just wastes time when you could be out on a scene. This is where the idea arose. The script uses a / command which allows all apparatus extras to be set with ease.

# How It Works
This script primarily works around 3 vehicles that I have set: Tower, Rescue, & Engine. By using the command:
/FD (vehicle:tower/rescue/engine) (station/scene)
Ex: /FD Tower Scene - This will equip all extras needed while at a scene.
Ex: /FD Tower Station - Will reset all extras back to how they would be at the station.

# How To Install
1. Drag file into folder
2. Drag folder in to server directory
3. Add folder name into server.cfg
